    <title>Hugo's nest of thoughts</title>
    <description>I hold a MsC from the faculty of Engineering, Lunds University. Even though I didn't study computer science this is my new born interest. I work as a developer and I try to take in as much as possible in the field. Currently I am interested in machine-learning and more specifically deep-learning. Python will be my preferred weapon of choice but soon enough I will also be able to wield C++.
